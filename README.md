## What I Learnt
* Webpack is powerful, but gulp can be implemented with less work, even faster to implement are VSC plugins although they can be buggy
* Typescript Fundamentals
* I prefer to use Sass than Less, Sass has more functionality, is clearer to read and to use.
* Bootstrap can speed things up and have some useful features (maybe it will grow on me) but for now I would like to have total control of CSS 
* Promises can help speed loading times as it allows parallel programing

# What I Can Improve
* Write Object-Oriented Programming, SOLID, Clean Code etc
