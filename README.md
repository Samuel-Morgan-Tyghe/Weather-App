## What I Learnt
* Webpack is very powerful, but gulp can be implimented with less work, even faster to impliment are VSC plugins although they can be buggy
* Typescript Fundamentals
* I prefer to use Sass than Less, Sass has more functionality, is clearer to read and to use.
* Bootstrap can speed things up and has some really useful features (maybe it will grow on me) but for now i like to have total control of css 
* Promises can help speed loading times as it allows parralel programing

# What I Can Improve
* Try Writing Object Oriented Programming
